# Gattonero UI

Gattonero UI is a React-based design system that provides a set of reusable components and utilities for building modern web applications. This repository showcases how to create a lightweight design system using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS, while ensuring code quality with Jest, maintaining thorough documentation and library previews with Storybook, and managing package versioning with Semantic Versioning (semver) through conventional commits and Commitizen.
